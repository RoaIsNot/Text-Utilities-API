# Text Utilities API

A lightweight and easy-to-use API for developers to process and analyze text.  
It provides multiple endpoints for common text-related tasks, making it easy to integrate text utilities into your projects without building your own backend logic from scratch.

### Key Features
- **Word Count:** Count the number of words in any text.  
- **Character Count:** Count the number of characters, including spaces.  
- **Text Transformations:** Convert text to uppercase, lowercase, or reverse it.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.  
- **Keyword Extraction:** Automatically extract important words from a piece of text while ignoring common stopwords.

### Who is this for?
This API is designed for:
- Developers building apps that need text analysis features quickly.  
- Hobbyists who want to experiment with text processing.  
- Anyone learning Node.js and TypeScript and wants a ready-made API to test and extend.

### Why this API exists
Building text utilities from scratch can be repetitive and time-consuming.  
This API provides a **ready-to-use service** that developers can integrate immediately, saving time and effort.  
Even in prototype form, it demonstrates best practices in API design and TypeScript usage.

### Prototype Notes
- This is an **early-stage prototype**.  
- Hosting and API key authentication are **not yet implemented**.  
- The focus is on feedback: endpoint usefulness, response format, and potential improvements.  

Your feedback is invaluable — if you have suggestions for new endpoints, features, or improvements, please share!
